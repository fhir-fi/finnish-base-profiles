This implementation guide does not profile scheduling related resources.

However, references to [Appointment](), [Schedule](), and [Slot]() resources are included here in
order to draw the readers attention to another implementation guide published by HL7 Finland:

* [Finnish Scheduling](https://hl7.fi/fhir/finnish-scheduling/)

In addition to implementation guides published by HL7 Finland, there is also ongoing work on FHIR
APIs for scheduling in the national Kanta system.

<p>Do note also the older implementation guides by HL7 Finland:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://simplifier.net/finnishappointment/">Finnish Appointment</a></li>
<li><a href="https://simplifier.net/finnishschedulingr4/">Finnish Scheduling</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The contents of both of these older implementation guides are now considered outdated.</p>
<p>The concepts and resources have been used, most notably by <a href="https://www.omaolo.fi"
>Omaolo</a> symptom assessment services, <a
href="https://www.cgi.com/fi/fi/tuoteratkaisut/sahkoinen-asiointialusta">Palveluohjain</a> service
(previously known <i lang="fi">ajanvaraus ja palveluohjain -sovellus</i> AVPH) scheduling service,
and the scheduling API of the <a href="https://www.cgi.com/fi/fi/tuoteratkaisut/omni360"
>OMNI360</a> electronic health record system.</p>
<p>Implementers should read these implementation guides with caution and verify the latest state of
the art from their customers or from vendors of real world implementations.</p>
<p>HL7 Finland is currently considering updating the published implementation guides.</p>
