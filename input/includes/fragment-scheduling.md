This implementation guide does not profile scheduling related resources.

However, references to [Appointment](), [Schedule](), and [Slot]() resources are included here in
order to draw the readers attention to the
[Finnish Appointment](https://simplifier.net/finnishappointment/) implementation guide published by
HL7 Finland.

That implementation guide is already a bit outdated, but the concepts and resources are used, most
notably by [Omaolo](https://www.omaolo.fi) symptom assessment services and
[AVPH](https://www.solita.fi/asiakkaat/palveluohjain-sujuvoittaa-suomalaisten-arkea/)
(_ajanvaraus ja palveluohjain -sovellus_) scheduling service, and the scheduling API of the
[OMNI360](https://www.cgi.com/fi/fi/tuoteratkaisut/omni360) electronic health record system.

There is also ongoing work on FHIR APIs for scheduling in the national Kanta system.
