This implementation guide does not profile scheduling related resources.

However, references to [Appointment](), [Schedule](), and [Slot]() resources are included here in
order to draw the readers attention to two previous implementation guides published by
HL7 Finland:
* [Finnish Appointment](https://simplifier.net/finnishappointment/) implementation guide
* [Finnish Scheduling](https://simplifier.net/finnishschedulingr4/) implementation guide

There is also ongoing work on FHIR APIs for scheduling in the national Kanta system.

<section class="dragon">
<p>The contents of both of the implementation guides published by HL7 Finland are already a bit
outdated.</p>
<p>The concepts and resources are used, most notably by <a href="https://www.omaolo.fi">Omaolo</a>
symptom assessment services and <a
href="https://www.solita.fi/asiakkaat/palveluohjain-sujuvoittaa-suomalaisten-arkea/">AVPH</a>
(_ajanvaraus ja palveluohjain -sovellus_) scheduling service, and the scheduling API of the
[OMNI360](https://www.cgi.com/fi/fi/tuoteratkaisut/omni360) electronic health record system.</p>
<p>Still, implementers should read these implementation guides with caution and verify the latest
state of the art from their customers or from vendors of real world implementations.</p>
<p>HL7 Finland is currently considering updating the published implementation guides.</p>
