See also the [Medication Codes](terminology.html#medication-codes) section on the terminology page
of this guide, and the [Medications Module](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medications-module.html) of
the main FHIR specification.

For all medication related resources (Medication, MedicationAdministration, MedicationRequest,
MedicationStatement), please also see the
[Prescription project](https://www.kanta.fi/en/system-developers/prescription) and the related
[implementation guide](https://simplifier.net/guide/finnishkantamedicationr4) of the Kanta system.
That project contains useful definitions, examples, and sequence descriptions (mostly in Finnish).
