See also the [Medications Module](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medications-module.html) of the main
FHIR specification.

For all medication related resources (Medication, MedicationAdministration, MedicationStatement),
please also see the [Prescription project](https://www.kanta.fi/en/system-developers/prescription)
and the related [implementation guide](https://simplifier.net/guide/finnishkantamedicationr4) of
the Kanta system. That project contains useful definitions, examples, and sequence descriptions
(mostly in Finnish).
