### Scope and Usage

The purpose of Municipality code is to represent home municipality of the patient. Home municipality differs from address information which represents the postal adress of the patient. In most cases the postal address is at the home municipality but for instance due to work location one might have separate residence which serves as a postal address. Actual home address or municipality is in a different location.

The distiction between these two different location types is important e.g. when patient is being transferred from primary care to secondary care via referral. In these cases the secondary care unit invoices the primary care unit but patient may recieve infromation about the given care via mail.
