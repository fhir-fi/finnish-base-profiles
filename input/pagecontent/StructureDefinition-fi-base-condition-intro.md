### Scope and Usage

FiBaseReasonForCare SHOULD be used for  Diagnosis -based conditions and Finnish *kayntisyy*
conditions instead of this.

This profile may be used for describing reason given by patient for requesting/acquiring healthcare
service (Finnish *tulosyy*).

TODO add some general text for other uses of condition. Do we need to identify them?
