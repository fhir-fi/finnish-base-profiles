### Scope and Usage

The FI Base MedicationStatement profile requires that references from the MedicationStatement
resource to other resources are to resources that also conform to the Finnish Base Profiles.

This profile can be used to ensure greater compatibility, but it should not be expected that all
MedicationStatements within the Finnish healthcare IT ecosystem conform to this profile.

This implementation guide does present examples of the MedicationStatement resource
being used in Finnish context.

For patient access use cases, please see the
[FI SMART MedicationStatement](https://hl7.fi/fhir/finnish-smart/StructureDefinition-fi-smart-medicationStatement.html)
profile of the Finnish SMART implementation guide.
