Note that a previous version of this example referred to extensions defined in another
implementation guide, the
[FinnishScheduling R4](https://simplifier.net/finnishschedulingr4/) IG. That schedulinig IG has
since been updated and the canonical urls defined for the extensions have changed from
`http://hl7.fi/fhir/StructureDefinition/ServiceEventExt`to
[`https://hl7.fi/fhir/finnish-base-profiles/StructureDefinition/service-event`](./StructureDefinition-service-event.html)
and from
`http://hl7.fi/fhir/StructureDefinition/AppointmentMutabilityExtension` to
[`https://hl7.fi/fhir/finnish-scheduling/StructureDefinition/mutable`](https://hl7.fi/fhir/finnish-scheduling/StructureDefinition-mutable.html).
Note that the service event extension has been moved to this implementation guide. Also note that
the previous URLs do not resolve, the new ones do.
