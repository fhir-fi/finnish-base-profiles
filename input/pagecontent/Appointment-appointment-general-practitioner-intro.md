This example refers to extensions defined in another implementation guide, the
[FinnishScheduling R4](https://simplifier.net/finnishschedulingr4/) IG, and has errors in the
[QA Report](qa.html) for this guide. The schedulinig IG is about to be updadted and the
canonical urls defined for the extensions may change, at least to have a `https` protocol instead
of `http`.
