This page lists notable terminologies used in Finland.

Many of these terminologies are not maintained by HL7 Finland, rather they are published and
maintained elsewhere and included into this implementation guide to raise awareness of their
existence.

When terminologies are readily available in FHIR format, they are imported into this implementation
guide. However, this is currently a manual process and there is no guarantee that the terminologies
are kept up to date with official versions. Readers are encouraged to check the original source of
the terminologies for up-to-date information.

When terminologies are not available in FHIR format, this implementation guide links to the
definitions published elsewhere.

Also please note that most code systems used in this guide are defined in the base FHIR
specification. They are not replicated here.
