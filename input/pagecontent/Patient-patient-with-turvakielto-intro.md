The TURVAKIELTO label is the first code to be added into the
[Finnish CodeSystem for security labels](CodeSystem-SecurityLabelCS.html). Many other codes are
likely to be added, including codes for other
|data protection preferences in the Suomi.fi infrastructure](https://dvv.fi/en/data-protection) and
codes for
[permissions for health data sharing from the Kanta system](https://www.kanta.fi/en/consent-and-denials-of-consent-to-data-sharing).
Implementer feedback regarding this approach and regarding codes that should be added is
appreciated!
