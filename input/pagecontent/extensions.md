The primary way to adapt the FHIR specification to specific requirements of a jurisdiction is
through [extensions](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility.html).

This list includes the FI Base extensions as well as other known extesions used in Finland. We hope
listing extensions here will promote their use and thereby increase interoperability.

</ul>

In addition to this list, a
[registry of standard extensions](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility-registry.html) can
be found in the FHIR specification and additional extensions may be registered on the HL7 FHIR
registry at [http://hl7.org/fhir/registry](http://hl7.org/fhir/registry).
