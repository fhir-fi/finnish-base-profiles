The primary way to adapt the FHIR specification to specific requirements of a jurisdiction is
through [extensions](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility.html).

This list includes the FI Base extensions as well as other known extesions used in Finland. We hope
listing extensions here will promote their use and thereby increase interoperability.

Please note that there is no guarantee that the extensions from other sources are kept in sync with
the source implementation guides. For up-to-date information, please refer to the original
definitions (which can be read from the `Official URL` part of the page describing the extension,
or from the `url` field of the relevant StructureDefinition resouce). For Kanta PHR extensions 
(with URLs starting http://phr.kanta.fi) see the 
[Finnish PHR implementation guide](https://simplifier.net/FinnishPHRR4).

In addition to this list, a
[registry of standard extensions](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility-registry.html) can
be found in the FHIR specification and additional extensions may be registered on the HL7 FHIR
registry at [http://hl7.org/fhir/registry](http://hl7.org/fhir/registry).
