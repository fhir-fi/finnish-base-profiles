The primary way to adapt the FHIR specification to specific requirements of a jurisdiction is
through [extensions](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility.html).

### Extensions for Finnish Base Profiles

This list includes the extensions for base profiles defined by HL7 Finland.

### Extensions in other Finnish Implementation Guides

There are other, more use case specific extensions defined in other implementation guides. For
instance:
* Both the [Finnish Appointment IG](https://simplifier.net/finnishappointment) and the
  [Finnish Scheduling IG](https://simplifier.net/finnishschedulingr4/) for scheduling
* Both the [Finnish PHR STU3](https://simplifier.net/FinnishPHR) and the
  [Finnish PHR R4](https://simplifier.net/FinnishPHRR4) for health and wellbeing data in the
  national Personal Health Record platform Kanta PHR
* The [Kanta FHIR Prescription R4](https://simplifier.net/PrescriptionR4) for prescriptions
* The [Kanta sosiaalihuolto R4](https://simplifier.net/Kanta-sosiaalihuolto-R4) for welfare and
  social affairs

### Other Extensions

In addition to above, a
[registry of standard extensions](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility-registry.html) can
be found in the FHIR specification and additional extensions may be registered on the HL7 FHIR
registry at [http://hl7.org/fhir/registry](http://hl7.org/fhir/registry).
