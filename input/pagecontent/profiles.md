Below are two lists of Finnish FHIR profiles.

### FI Base Profiles

This is the list of FHIR resources profiled for use in Finland, published and maintained by HL7
Finland.

### Kanta PHR Profiles

This is the list of profiles from the Kanta PHR, where a lot of early profiling has been done.
It is worth noting that these profiles are more restrictive than the national base profiles. They
are still listed here, to increase awareness of work already done and to act as inspiration.
