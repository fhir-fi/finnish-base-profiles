### Scope and Usage

The FI Base Observation profile requires that references from the Observation resource to other
resources are to resources that also conform to the Finnish Base Profiles.

This profile can be used to ensure greater compatibility, but it should not be expected that all
Observations within the Finnish healthcare IT ecosystem conform to this profile.
