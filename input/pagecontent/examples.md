This list includes the examples included in this implementation guide. Please note that the list
contains examples of FI Base resources as well as examples from other known implementations from
Finland. We hope listing many examples here promotes awareness of what has already been done and
thereby increases interoperability.

These example instances show what data produced and consumed by systems conforming with this
implementation guide might look like. Every effort has been made to ensure that the examples are
correct and useful, but they are not a normative part of the specification nor are they fully
representative of real world examples.

Before deriving any conclusions from the examples alone, please do check the
[quality asssurance report](qa.html) of this implementation guide to learn about the identified
issues and non-conformities of examples.
