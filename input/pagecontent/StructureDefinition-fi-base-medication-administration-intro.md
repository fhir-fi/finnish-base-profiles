### Scope and Usage

The FI Base MedicationAdministration profile requires that references from the
MedicationAdministration resource to other resources are to resources that also conform to the
Finnish Base Profiles.

This profile can be used to ensure greater compatibility, but it should not be expected that all
MedicationAdministrations within the Finnish healthcare IT ecosystem conform to this profile.

This implementation guide does present examples of the MedicationAdministration resource
being used in Finnish context.
