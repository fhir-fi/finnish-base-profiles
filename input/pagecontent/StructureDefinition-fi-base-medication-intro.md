### Scope and Usage

See also the [Medications Module](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medications-module.html) of the main
FHIR specification.

### Kanta Prescription Project

Please also note the [Prescription project](https://www.kanta.fi/en/system-developers/prescription)
and the related [implementation guide](https://simplifier.net/guide/finnishkantamedicationr4) of
the Kanta system. That project contains useful definitions, examples, and sequence descriptions.
Unfortunately the implementation guide is only available in Finnish.
