### Scope and Usage

The FI Base Medication profile requires that references from the Medication resource to other
resources are to resources that also conform to the Finnish Base Profiles.

This profile can be used to ensure greater compatibility, but it should not be expected that all
Medications within the Finnish healthcare IT ecosystem conform to this profile.

This implementation guide does present examples of the Medication resource being used in Finnish
context.

For patient access use cases, please see the
[FI SMART Medication](https://hl7.fi/fhir/finnish-smart/StructureDefinition-fi-smart-medication.html)
profile of the Finnish SMART implementation guide.
