### Scope and Usage

The FI Base MedicationRequest profile requires that references from the MedicationRequest
resource to other resources are to resources that also conform to the Finnish Base Profiles.

This profile can be used to ensure greater compatibility, but it should not be expected that all
MedicationRequests within the Finnish healthcare IT ecosystem conform to this profile.

This implementation guide does present examples of the MedicationRequest resource
being used in Finnish context.

For patient access use cases, please see the
[FI SMART MedicationRequest](https://hl7.fi/fhir/finnish-smart/StructureDefinition-fi-smart-medicationRequest.html)
profile of the Finnish SMART implementation guide.
